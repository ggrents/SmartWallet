## About
Smart Wallet is an API developed by me for convenient management of my finances. 
Using the application, you can conveniently control your savings in different currencies, which allows you to reach a new level of financial literacy.
Smart Wallet is becoming an essential tool for people who seek to increase their financial awareness and effectively manage their savings.

## Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of my project! My application was created using the powerful FastAPI framework and provides a wide range of functionality for anyone who needs to control their money.

------------Dependencies-------------

My project uses various Python libraries and packages to provide its functionality. These dependencies are specified in the file requirements.txt which makes the installation process very convenient.
After activating the virtual environment, you will work in an isolated environment where only the dependencies of your project will be installed. This helps to avoid conflicts between different projects and simplifies dependency management.
Now, after installing the dependencies and activating the virtual environment, your project should be ready to launch.

## Using the project

1. Registration and authorization:

The application has implemented the possibility of authorization using JWT tokens from scratch, as well as all the necessary validations. 
To gain access to authorized users by the endpoint, it is necessary to specify the token received from the endpoint login in the authorization header

2. Account replenishment:

The user has the opportunity to replenish his balance in KZT currency in order 
to further distribute funds to different accounts

3. Creating accounts in different currencies:

Users can create an infinite number of accounts with the offered currencies.
The ability to create multiple accounts allows users to accurately structure their financial flows, 
which opens up a wide range of strategic opportunities for them to achieve financial goals

4. Secure transfers between accounts:

Smart Wallet provides users with a unique functionality for making instant transfers between their own accounts. 
This includes the ability to move funds between accounts configured for different currencies, which makes accounting and conversion easy and convenient.
In addition, Smart Wallet allows users to make secure and secure transfers even to other people's accounts, which makes the application an essential tool for personal and business finance. 
All financial transactions in SmartWallet are provided with a high level of encryption and security, which guarantees the safety of personal information and user funds.

5. Application Administration:

The application implements endpoints for administrators that allow monitoring, managing and controlling user transactions to prevent unwanted traffic.
